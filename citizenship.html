   <ul>Yes, I believe that honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage
  are necessary components of good citizenship.
      <li>Citizenship: the position or status of being a citizen of a particular country.</li>
      <li>Honesty is necessary because it makes communication easier.</li>
      <li>Compassion is important because it leads to the support of one another.</li>
      <li>Respect is important to avoid conflict.</li>
      <li>Responsibility is important so we can take care of ourselves.</li>
      <li>Courage is important so we can do what we love.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strength is also an important component of citizenship.</p>
<p>Recently, I got a good grade on my test. This was an act of citizenship because it is a product of hard work.</p>
